<h1>Nissy</h1>

<p class=subtitle>A Rubik's cube solver and FMC assistant</p>

<p>
Nissy is a command-line Rubik's cube solver. It can find optimal solutions
for random positions using techniques from Herbert Kociemba's
<a href="http://kociemba.org/cube.htm">Cube Explorer</a> and
Tomas Rokicki's
<a href="https://github.com/rokici/cube20src/blob/master/nxopt.md">nxopt</a>.
With 4 cores at 2.5GHz and using about 3Gb of RAM, Nissy can find an optimal
solution in about a minute on average.
</p>

<p>
Nissy aims at being a complete tool
for FMC (Fewest Moves Challenge) practice. It can solve different steps
of Thistlethwaite's algorithm (also know as DR/HTR) and cans use NISS
(Normal-Inverse Scramble Switch).
</p>

<p>
You should use Nissy if:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
You want to analyze your DR solutions or check for multiple optimal
(or sub-optimal) solutions for EO/DR/HTR or similar steps.
</li>
<li>
You just want a Rubik's cube solver and you like command line interfaces.
</li>
<li>
You want an alternative to Cube Explorer.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
To get started, head to the <a href="/download/">download</a> page.
</p>

<p>
You can also look at its source code by cloning the git repository:
</p>

<pre>
<code>git clone https://git.tronto.net/nissy-classic</code>
</pre>

<p>
For a summary of changes and a list of older versions see the bottom of
this page. Some versions (for example 1.0) are not available directly,
but can be obtained from the git repository.

<h3>System requirements</h3>

<p>
A full installation of nissy requires about 3.1Gb of space,
of which 2.3Gb are occupied by the huge pruning table for fast optimal solving,
and running it requires the same amount of RAM.
One can choose to never use this function and not to install the relative
pruning table. There is an alternative (slower)
optimal solving function that uses about 500Mb of RAM.

When generating the pruning tables automatically (see the section Tables below),
at least 5.3Gb or RAM are required.
</p>

<h3>Windows</h3>

<p>
Try downloading and executing in a terminal the file <code>nissy.exe</code>,
then follow the instructions in the <strong>Tables</strong> section below for
installing the pruning tables.
If <code>nissy.exe</code> does not work, you can try following the UNIX instructions
in WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) or in a similar environment.
</p>

<h3>UNIX (Linux, MacOS, *BSD...)</h3>
<p>
Download the source archive (.tar.gz). Extract it
with your favorite archive program, for example with
</p>
<pre><code>tar -xvzf nissy-VERSION.tar.gz</code></pre>
<p>
Open a terminal in the directory just extracted.
If you wish, edit the <code>Makefile</code> to match your local configuration
(this is usually not necessary, but you may want to change the
<code>PREFIX</code> variable to change the installation path) and run
<pre><code>make</code></pre>
<p>
followed by
</p>
<pre><code>make install</code></pre>
<p>
Then follow the instructions below to install the pruning tables.
</p>

<h3>Tables</h3>

<p>
Once you have installed nissy, run
</p>

<pre><code>nissy gen</code></pre>

<p>
to generate all the tables that Nissy will ever need.
Running this command requires around 5.3Gb of RAM, and it can take some time
(about 90 minutes on my 9 year old but laptop, with 4 CPU threads).
</p>

<p>
Some unnecessary technical detail: by default this command is going to use
at most 64 threads. If you want you can choose to use more threads (if your CPU
is very powerful) or fewer threads (if you for example want to run this command
in the background while you do other stuff) with the <code>-t</code> option, for
example <code>nissy gen -t 1</code>.
</p>

<p>
Alternatively, you can
<a href="/nissy-tables-2.0.4.zip">download all the tables (1.7Gb)</a> and
copy them into the correct folder (see manual page, <code>ENVIRONMENT</code>
section). On UNIX operating systems this folder is either
<code>.nissy/tables</code> in the user's home directory or
<code>$XDG_DATA_HOME/nissy/tables</code> if the XDG variable is configured.
On Windows it is the same directory as the <code>nissy.exe</code> executable
file.
</p>

<h2 id="Upgrade">Upgrading</h2>
<p>
<strong> Important note for upgrading to 2.0.4:</strong>
A bug in 2.0.3 and earlier versions caused HTR-related tables to be
generated incorrectly on ARM platforms (Mac M1, Android...).
If you are upgrading to 2.0.4 on such a device, you need to re-generate
these tables. You can do this by removing all the files wiht <code>htr</code>
in their name and let nissy re-generate them (after upgrading), or by
downloading the <a href="/nissy-tables-2.0.4.zip">new tables</a> and
replacing the old ones.
</p>
<p>
If you already have nissy installed and you want to upgrade to a more
recent version, you can simply repeat the installation process:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
On Windows: simply replace nissy.exe with the new file with the same name.
</li>
<li>
On UNIX systems: download the new version of the source code, extract it in
a new folder and run <code>make</code> and <code>make install</code> again.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Between each version new table files might have been added, or old ones
may be not used anymore. Nissy will deal with this automatically.
</p>

<h3>Nissy v1</h3>

<p>
Nissy v1 was released in 2020. It was slow, full of bugs and the code
was quite terrible. But in practice it got its job done most of the time.
