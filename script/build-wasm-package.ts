/**
 * It's okay to increase this a bit, but anything approaching half a MiB is
 * pretty slow for intermittent mobile connections. Note that the entire
 * download has to happen before:
 *
 * - The base64 source is turned into WASM.
 *   - We can't use streaming instantiation (
 *     https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly/JavaScript_interface/instantiateStreaming
 *     ) due to `esbuild` limitations for portable code:
 *     https://github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/795
 * - The WASM is instantiated.
 * - The search code initializes.
 * - The actual search is performed.
 *
 * And that's not even counting potential steps beforehand:
 *
 * - HTTPS handshakes
 * - HTML download
 * - main script download and parsing
 * - module tree download and parsing
 * - JS code invocation for a search/scramble
 * - Worker instantiation (with half a dozen fallbacks to try first)
 * - Worker initialization and dynamic import of the base64 source.
 *
 * Since we are consolidating all scramble code in `twsearch`, this is a
 * bottleneck for *all* scrambles, even the trivial ones (e.g. Megaminx and
 * Clock).
 *
 * For more:
 *
 * - See https://github.com/cubing/cubing.js/issues/291 for an issue about
 *   performing more of these steps in parallel.
 * - See https://github.com/cubing/twsearch/issues/37 for an issue about
 *   decreasing the WASM build size directly.
