Notes on ksolve input format.

TL;DR:

Active permutations map items to slots.  Multiplication:  p3 = p2[p1[i]]
Passive permutations map slots to items.  Multiplication:  p3 = p1[p2[i]]

Ksolve move and state representation both use passive permutations
for the permutation aspect.

Ksolve state representation maps slots to orientation.

Ksolve move representation maps cubies to orientation; these are different.

This note discusses the puzzle representation used for ksolve move
definitions and positions, internal representation, and alternatives.
We will start by teasing out the semantics of just the permutations,
and follow this up with the necessary description of the orientations.

Permutations are well understood, with standard notations that are
well agreed upon.  We will assume the left-to-right application
order, so (p1 * p2) means apply permutation p1 first, then permutation
p2.  Further, we permit this to be written as simply p1 p2 (as we
normally do with puzzle sequence notation).

We will first discuss writing permutations on S_n as a list of n
objects (without parentheses), and later discuss the cycle notation.

For this discussion we will use the standard convention permuting
the set of numbers 1..n.  Internally we will probably instead use
the set of numbers 0..n-1, to match the convention in most programming
languages of 0-based arrays, and all input and output will be
appropriately transformed.

A permutation can be written either as a transformation (the active
form), or as a ordered sequence (the passive form).

In the active form, a permutation written as 2 3 1 4 means that the
item currently in the first slot is moved to the second position
(so sigma(1)=2)), and an item in the second position is moved to
the third position (so sigma(2)=3), and an item in the third position
is moved to the first position (so sigma(3)=1), and the item in the
fourth position is left alone.  Another way to interpret this is
that the item that used to be in the first position is in position
two, the item that used to be in position two is in position three,
and the item that used to be in position three is in position one.
When interpreting such a permutation as a position, the permutation
maps elements to slots.

In the passive form, a permutation written as 2 3 1 4 means that
the second item is currently in the first position, the third item
is currently in the second position, the first item is currently
in the third position, and the fourth item is in the fourth position.
To interpret this as a permutation, this says move the element in
the 2nd slot to the first position, and so on.  When interpreting
such a permutation as a position, the permutation maps slots to
elements, and as such is typically used for positions.

These representations are directly isomorphic; if you invert a
passive permutation, you get the active representation of the
original permutation, and vice versa.  Inversion can be performed
by the following code:

   for (i in 1..n) inv[p[i]] = i ;

So it doesn't matter if we use passive or active representations,
as long as we are clear in what we use.

So what is the difference?  Consider how we multiply two permutations.
If we are using the active representation and left-to-right application
order, then sigma_p1(a)=b means piece a moves to position b, and
then sigma_p2(b)=c means that it moves further to c, so sigma_(p1*p2)(a)
= sigma_p2(sigma_p1(a)).  Code to multiply two permutations looks
like this:

   for (i in 1..n) p3[i] = p2[p1[i]]

But if we are using the passive representation, with left-to-right
application order, then sigma_p1(a)=b means the piece that was in
b moves to a, and sigma_p2(c)=a means that the piece that was in a
moves to c, so sigma_(p1*p2)(a) = sigma_p1(sigma_p2(a)), or in code:

   for (i in 1..n) p3[i]=p1[p2[i]]

These are very different multiplication methods; getting multiplication
correct is fundamental.

In ksolve, according to the documentation, both moves and positions
are given as active permutations.  This is the standard in mathematics,
as well.  The quote from the readme is as follows:

"A permutation vector is a list of the numbers from 1 to n in some
order, such as 231456. This describes where each piece goes - for
instance, the 2 in the first spot means that piece number 1 is in
spot 2."

So this says that ksolve is using the element to slot notation,
which is the active form.  Yet, if you look at the 4x4 centers
definition file distributed with ksolve, the permutation vector for
the solved position is given as

    1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 3 4 4 4 4 5 5 5 5 6 6 6 6

and this cannot be an active permutation since it would try to cram
multiple elements into the same place.  This has to be a passive
permutation, mapping slot to element, with some identical elements.
Further, if you use the standard 3x3 def file, which has the solved
position for corners as 12345678, and the U move as 41235678 (the
corner orders are given as URF, ULF, ULB, URB, DRF, DLF, DLB, DRB),
then the U move says that the 4 (URB) in the first (URF) spot means
that piece 1 (URF) is in slot 4 (URB)".  But this is absolutely not
what the U move does; the U move puts the piece 4 (URB) in slot 1
(URF).  So ksolve is clearly using passive format throughout.

If you look at the ksolve code, in the move routine and in the merge
moves routine (which are both effectively multiplication, but
actually differ in terms of orientation, which we will be getting
to), the actual code used is:

   for (i in 1..n) p3[i] = p1[p2[i]]

This matches the passive mode multiplication procedure we derived
above.

In group theory, with no identical pieces, there is no a-priori
difference between a move and a position; they are both simply a
permutation.  One can think of a move as the position obtained after
making that move from the identity position; similarly, one can
think of a position as the composite move required to obtain that
position from the identity.

So far this agrees with the tests I've performed on ksolve as well
as its code, though it contradicts its documentation.  It's also
the most logical code; if we need to support identical pieces, our
positions must be passive, not active, and if our positions are
passive, it's easiest if our moves are passive as well.  This also
means that the move descriptions are the same as descriptions of
positions after the move, assuming the solved state is the identity
permutation, which makes writing them fairly easy.  Further, the
permutation vector in the solved state doesn't matter at all, except
in that it allows the definition of identical pieces.

Let's move on to orientations.

Orientations are just a concise way of specifying larger permutations.
For instance, on the 3x3x3 cube, there are 54 stickers, 9 on each
face; if you assume the centers do not move, then there are only
48.  When describing this as a group to software such as GAP or
Mathematica, you would describe it as a group generated by elements
of S_48 or S_54, and be done.  But there are good reasons to separate
the permutation into orbits (what ksolve calls sets) and further
to rewrite some of the orbits in terms of smaller permutations and
orientations rather than a larger permutation.

Each orientation value expands a single permutation element in the
small permutation to several in the larger permutation element.
These elements collectively move together, potentially cycling due
to rotations in three-dimensional space.  So instead of having 24
stickers moving on eight cubies, we can instead have the eight
cubies moving, and maintain how far each cubie is rotated against
some standard configuration.  This standard configuration involves
marking a single face as the primary face on every cubie, and then
keeping track of how far clockwise from the marked slot face the
actual cubie face is.

In passive notation the permutation maps slots to elements, so our
orientation should also map slots to orientations.  So if the value
at index a in our permutation is b and in our orientation is c,
that would seem to mean that piece b is currently in slot a in
orientation c.  This is a good representation in that it has the
following property:  orientation can be separated from permutation
for state exploration purposes, because when multiplying to states
s1 and s2, the orientation change depends only on s2 (the "move",
usually) and not on s1.  So we can index the orientation separately
from the permutation, which enables a lot of nice functionality.
Other orientation conventions complicate this.

(This is even nicer if you can arrange so the largest number of
moves do not affect the orientation in the solved state, because
then a pruning table created from orientation tends to have somewhat
higher values.)

Ksolve uses this representation for states, but critically, not for
moves.  For moves, ksolve maps cubie numbers to orientations.  So
ksolve states and moves are not the same representation of a
permutation, and this affects (and complicates) the code.

To convert a state to a move:

	m.o[p[i]] = s.o[i]

Note that the permutations are the same.  To convert a move to a state:

	s.o[i] = m.o[p[i]]

So for move 13425,01201 we convert to state 13425,02011.
For state 13425,02011 we convert to move 13425,01201.

sub movetostate      no[i]=o[p[i]] ;
sub statetomove      no[p[i]]=o[i] ;
sub sss      no[i] = (o1[p2[i]]+o2[i])%omod ;
sub sms      no[i] = (o1[p2[i]]+o2[p2[i]])%omod ;
sub mss      no[i] = (o1[p1[p2[i]]]+o2[i])%omod ;
sub mms      no[i] = (o1[p1[p2[i]]]+o2[p2[i]])%omod ;
sub mmm      no[p1[i]] = (o1[p1[i]]+o2[i])%omod ;
sub smm      no[p1[i]] = (o1[i]+o2[i])%omod ;
sub msm      no[p1[p2[i]]] = (o1[p1[p2[i]]]+o2[i])%omod ;
sub ssm      no[p1[p2[i]]] = (o1[p2[i]]+o2[i])%omod ;
sub sinv      no[p[i]] = (omod-o[i])%omod ;
sub minv      no[i] = (omod-o[p[i]])%omod ;

What our current project code does is use move representation
everywhere; so long as the solved state has default (0) orientation
everywhere, this works (and our code currently defines combine with
code like mmm above, and invert with code like minv above).  A
better approach is to instead use state representation everywhere;
the changes should be slight (combine needs to use code like sss
above, and invert code like minv, and we need to change the way we
display things.)  But in order for this to work we need to convert
the ksolve moves read in to be in state representation rather than
ksolve's move representation.

This is currently what both kpuzzle and twsearch do; on reading a
move, it is converted to the ksolve state representation, in which
orientations map slots to orientations, and then internally we use
a consistent representation for moves and states.  Of course with
identical pieces states always have to be on the left side of any
multiplication, but this is true for ksolve as well.
